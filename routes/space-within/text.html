  		<h2 id='text'>SPACE WITHIN</h2>

  	<section>
  		<p>A space contained within the volume of a larger space.</strong>
<br> Interlocking Spaces. The field of a space overlaps the volume of another space. 
<br> Adjacent Spaces. Two spaces share a common border.

<br> Every space has space within. Like a Russian doll, space is made up of more space that can be examined and explored. 
Everything is relative. The acknowledgment and acceptance of an established space doesn't  discard the need to search outside of the preexisting space, but allows for comparison and deeper comprehension of both the inside and out. A return to the space within is against the human nature to search outward. 

<br> Search: Try to find something by looking or otherwise seeking carefully and thoroughly. Associated with movement. Going to search, Actively searching.

<br> Perhaps a better word is Uncover: Remove a cover or covering from.

<br> Space within is both comforting and exciting. There is a feeling of resting in the true nature that is associated with space within – like coming home to a place that seems familiar and comforting even if you’ve not been there for a very long time.
You set yourself a boundary of exploration, and by limiting yourself you can focus on a deeper search of a specific space.</p>
