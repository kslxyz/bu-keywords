									<h2><center>Everything Happens for a Reason</center></h2>
									<p>There is one motto that has carried me through every trial since middle school. It wasn’t an easy phrase to honor, to recognize, to believe, but as difficult as it was to truly fall in love with it, it was just as rewarding, comforting, and familiar. 
									Everything happens for a reason. Cliche and overused, yet such a few hold the ability to truly use its power, and everything it offers. When I started believing that everything happens for a reason, life didn’t become so serious. 
									Life didn’t become so toxic, so competitive, so burdensome- it became kind, young, and understanding. 
									Reason is defined as: a statement offered in explanation or justification, the power of the mind to think, understand, and form judgments by a process of logic. </p>
									<br>Reason exists to seek the truth. But to me, reason is a belief that can exist on its own. <br>
									
									<p>Everything happens for a reason, but I don’t feel the need to seek out what that reason is. 
									It happens, and while there is reason, it’s not worth spending my life seeking it, trying to analyze and understand it. 
									If life was all about trying to chase and hunt down the reason for everything that happens, that wouldn’t be living- it’s dying. 
									When reason consumes art, there is death of creativity, death of interpretation, the death of fun. 
									The death of comfort, the death of ideas, the death of artistic freedom. Everything happens for a reason, but not everything calls for analysis.</p>
									
									<p>A designer chooses to design their work a certain way, for a reason, but as soon as they are demanded for the reasoning of his/her choice, their work can lose value- that mystery, the freedom of interpretation, the freedom of their art. 
									Once a work is labeled with reason, immediately, walls are built to limit the viewer’s creative interpretation. The designer locks their designs in a cage, where ideas and analysis have borders. </p>
									<p><center><strong> Reason to me, is defined as a truth that will show itself with time, and a belief that exists to simply exist, not seeking anything.</strong></center></p>
