<img style="display:block; height:10vw; margin-left:7vw;" src="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/16124242/original_7e8bfb11e27ed3f4404c62376c3d1ed0.gif?1650394156?bc=0">

      <p style="margin-top:11vw;">Unlike Nintendo or Sega—whose mascots are so widely recognized I’m not even going to bother to name them here—Sony never quite established an adorable cartoon character of its own for the PlayStation. Today, you can make a case for Crash Bandicoot, or LittleBigPlanet’s Sackboy, or (if you’re in a particularly bloodthirsty mood) God of War’s Kratos.</p>

      <p>But if you’d asked me back in 1997, I wouldn’t have hesitated before naming PaRappa the Rapper—an insecure dog who hones his rapping skills so he can impress his crush, an anthropomorphic flower named Sunny Funny. This week, Sony released a remastered version of the original PaRappa the Rapper on the PlayStation Network, so you can play (or replay) PaRappa all over again.</p>

      <p>How did a game as singular as PaRappa come together in the first place? In a 2005 interview, Rodney Greenblat—the artist responsible for PaRappa’s distinctive art style—shed some light on the game’s development, which was pioneered by designer and musician Masaya Matsuura. "Sony just wanted games; the PlayStation was new and they wanted a variety," Greenblat explained. "And they already had tons of people working on [FPSes], racing games, flying games, role-playing games. They already had that going, tons of them. So they had another division, we were called Division Zero, where we just did whatever."</p>

      <p>As it turns out, "doing whatever" led to a game as bizarre and distinctive as PaRappa. The gameplay itself is simple: PaRappa evaluates the player’s rhythmic prowess by tasking you with pressing buttons that correspond with various rap lyrics, taught by rap masters that include a kung-fu master with an onion for a head, a cranky moose who administers driver’s tests, and a very stoned frog. Along the way, the game evaluates each of PaRappa’s raps as AWFUL, BAD, GOOD, or COOL, which is how I’d like all my real-life performance reviews to be delivered in the future.</p>

      <p>This bare-bones gameplay is strung together with a wonderfully loopy plot. Over the course of the game, PaRappa takes kung-fu lessons, gets his driver’s license, bakes a seafood birthday cake for Sunny, gets diarrhea from the seafood birthday cake, and takes over a concert headlined by some kind of Rastafarian flea. How do you market a game this bizarre? With some of the most obnoxious, inscrutable commercials I’ve ever seen:</p>

      <p>"Once you’ve played it, you can’t get it out of your head," mumbles the bored voiceover. Is that an endorsement or a threat?</p>

      <p>By any rational estimate, PaRappa should have been an oddball one-off with a passionate cult following, like No One Can Stop Mr Domino! or Incredible Crisis. And yet, somehow, PaRappa was a huge hit. The original PaRappa sold more than three million copies, spawning a sequel and a rock-based spinoff called UmJammer Lammy. Its success paved the way for a brief boomlet of rhythm games in the years that followed—most notably, Guitar Hero and Rock Band, which used plastic peripherals shaped like actual instruments to approximate the experience of being in a band.</p>

      <p>PaRappa the Rapper came out 20 years ago. Ahhhhhhhhhh! You’re old. So am I. Sorry. So when I sat down to play the remastered PaRappa this week, I had two big questions:</p>

      <p>Would the muscle memory from all that time I spent playing PaRappa 20 years ago kick right back in?
      Would I discover that PaRappa the Rapper had actually sucked all along?</p>

      <p>As it turns out, the answers to those questions are:</p>

      <p>God, no.
      Kind of.</p>

      <p>Here are all the things that suck about PaRappa. The gameplay is kind of broken, because the buttons you’re supposed to hit don’t quite match up with the prompts on-screen. It’s up to the player to figure out they should ignore the screen in favor of playing along to the beat of the music. This unforgiving (and arguably unfair) difficulty might have been by design, in an effort to artificially extend the length of the game, since PaRappa is insanely short—just six songs, unless you get stuck failing and replaying the same level over and over again (like, to be purely hypothetical, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDvt85lzpUc"target="_blank">goddamn cooking chicken</a>):
      </p>

      <p>And then there are the songs themselves, which are as nonsensical as they are catchy. A few sample lyrics:</p>

      <p>I'm working in the flea market so early / I’ve been working here ever since my mama was a baby
      Whatever you like's in the middle, fiddle / Seafood cake comes just like the riddle
      I am a chicken from the kitchen / And I ain’t kiddin’ / Although nothing is written
      Sunny's my life / She's like a dice / I cannot tell which way she'll turn ’til I spice</p>

      <p>In the middle of the game, you might be too focused to realize that most of PaRappa’s lyrics barely even make sense—but once they’ve been stuck in your head for days and days, trying to make sense of them might actually drive you insane.</p>

      <p>It’s hard to overstate how annoying it is to watch the crowd glumly wander out when you <a href="https://youtu.be/LIyibFd6WaA" target="_blank">fuck up PaRappa’s big solo</a> for the eighth consecutive time—but if you’ve ever played this game, you know what I mean.</p>

      <p>And then there’s the ending song, "I Gotta Believe!!," which exacerbates every problem by breaking the "rap teacher" format and making you go solo. In theory, this is the ideal climax for PaRappa: Having learned a different style of rap from each of his teachers (and bested them in a rap battle while in line for the toilet), PaRappa cuts loose and does his own thing. But the lack of guidance means you get no warning about which button-presses are going to appear on the next line, so you’re forced to play the stage over and over again until you have the last verse memorized. That also means replaying from the beginning, so you’re stuck repeating the first three minutes, which are weirdly easy, before you get a crack at those final 30 seconds again. It’s hard to overstate how annoying it is to watch the crowd glumly wander out of the theater when you fuck up PaRappa’s big solo for the eighth consecutive time—but if you’ve ever played this game, you know exactly what I mean.</p>

      <p>For better or worse, this PaRappa the Rapper remaster fixes none of those problems, opting instead to replicate the same experience you remember from 20 years ago. PaRappa the Rapper looks way better, but it’s essentially the same controller-throwing experience you remember from your middle school days.</p>

      <p>I can't imagine any of that sounded like a ringing endorsement. And yet… I still love PaRappa. I know! I can’t explain it either. Call it Stockholm syndrome after so much time in the PaRappa-verse, but it’s just a blast to kick around with this game, warts and all. Maybe the music and the gameplay are just good enough to overcome the baked-in flaws. Or maybe PaRappa is just so irrepressibly charming—in visual design, in the goofy-ass story, and in the low-key cheeriness of the whole thing—that its shortcomings are ultimately forgivable.</p>

      <p>Which is why it’s sad that PaRappa has fallen on such hard times. Following the two PaRappa games and UmJammer Lammy, Greenblat and Matsuura collaborated on just one more video game: The 2009 Nintendo Wii exclusive Major Minor’s Majestic March, which put the player in charge of a marching band. (The reception was, uh, not as positive.)</p>

      <p>So my main takeaway from the PaRappa remaster is that we’re long overdue for a new PaRappa. The formula is airtight enough that it doesn’t really need any modifying. Clean up the gameplay, throw a dozen new songs together, and come up with some weird new ways for PaRappa to try to woo Sunny Funny. You might not sell three million copies, but these games have always found an audience before. And if PaRappa 3 sounds a pipe dream… well, what would PaRappa say?</p>

    <a href="https://ultimatehistoryvideogames.jimdofree.com/dance-aerobics/" target="_blank"><h3>Review - Questicle.net (2011)</h3></a>

    <img style="display:block; height:20vw; margin-left:7vw;" src="https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=489x10000:format=jpg/path/s45d479059abc969b/image/ie71a0972663763f2/version/1555854195/dance-aerobics-nes.jpg">

    <p style="margin-top:21vw;">"Dust off a pink leotard and your Power Pad, ’cause it’s time for aerobics of the dancing variety! Choose from one of three modes – Dance Aerobics, Pad Antics, or Aerobic Studios – and get to steppin’. Dance Aerobics eases you into simple aerobic exercise routines with the Power Pad: move right onto button eight, left onto button four, raise your legs to ungodly heights, it’s all a rich tapestry. The instructor has a Power Pad herself and will show you all the moves you need to make on screen. Miss ten moves per class (the Power Pad is your aerobics partner and tattle tale all at once) and the game recommends that you “exercise more.” After you complete each aerobics class, you’ll be given a Pass Number (a password) and pushed forward to the next class: more routines, crazier movements, deeper burn. All told, there are eight Dance Aerobics classes to complete, and despite the feeling that you’re in your mother’s exercise class from the 80s, they’re an all-around solid workout.</p>

    <p>Pad Antics has three options of its own: “Tune Up,” “Mat Melodies,” and “Ditto.” Tune Up allows you to make your own song on the Power Pad, as all but the two buttons in the middle of the Pad correspond to musical notes. Even if you’re a musical savant who’s composed on every instrument from bandolins to keytars, I’d wager you’ve never made a song on a Power Pad; Dance Aerobics and “Tune Up” dare you to dream. Mat Melodies presents a simple song (in my case “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star”) and has you play along on the Pad. Green dots on the on-screen Power Pad show you where to step, but I couldn’t bear to hear the Melodies the game wanted me to Mat, so I quit prematurely. “Ditto” is the best of the three anyway, a one-person version of Twister that shows you where to put both hands and feet on the Pad, and gives you points for doing so. Skip the musical nonsense and indulge in that.</p>

    <p>Aerobic Studios is similar to Dance Aerobics, though taken in five, ten, fifteen, or twenty minute long chunks instead of eight increasingly difficult classes. Follow along on the Pad with the instructor’s movements to prevent your score from decreasing. Successfully complete a routine and your score will increase back to 100. Why you would care about a score if all you’re wanting to do is work out, I’m not sure. Dance Aerobics, God bless it, like society itself, feels the need to constantly judge and pick apart our failings. Considering Power Pads are pushing the quarter-century mark, perhaps the problem lies not with our inability to follow directions and more with the musty sensors not doing their job properly. But that could just be my wide bottom talking."</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gritty-underground-network-bringing-japan-arcades-to-us/" target="_blank">The Gritty, Underground Network Bringing Japan’s Arcades to the US</a></h3>
    <p>After falling in love with an obscure anime rhythm game, I became obsessed with obtaining a machine of my own—or finding the people who could.</p>
    <p>Last October, Phil Arrington precariously balanced a dream on the cargo bed of his 2002 Ford Ranger pickup. It was a stupid dream, but it did not deserve to die on a dolly behind a beige warehouse.</p>

    <p>Arrington was hunched over the dolly, gold chain dangling over a tight gray tee. Between his arms, leaned at a 45-degree angle, was a video game arcade machine; its title, MUSECA, could be glimpsed over his shoulder. The machine had come a long way—from an arcade in Tokyo to an anonymous warehouse in Osaka and then, after a long wait on a container ship outside Long Beach, California, to Arrington’s warehouse in San Pedro. Arrington effortfully wheeled the 6-foot-tall cabinet toward the pickup’s hatch. On the concrete 3 feet below lay a thin, blue blanket. Nearby, a phone was recording.</p>

    <p>Scuttling, repositioning, crouching, grunting, Arrington pushed the machine’s weight centimeter by centimeter, second after second. Suddenly, the dolly’s wheels slid off the edge. His whole body spilled forward and the arcade cabinet plunged to the ground with a fractious crash. Under the video Arrington uploaded to Twitter, gamers expressed their alarm. “This is the scariest thing I’ve seen on the internet,” said one. Said another, vividly, “I don’t think my asshole has ever puckered harder.”</p>

    <p>Watching the video from across the country in Brooklyn, I screamed. It was my machine.</p>

    <img style="display:block; height:20vw; margin-left:7vw;" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/61df810614ec8fbe076333c2/master/w_1600,c_limit/E95A0596.jpg">

    <br>

    <p style="margin-top:20vw;">Arrington chose his moment to explain himself, and it was a couple of days later, live on Twitch, squatting in a red bucket, fishing out the dusty remnants from a half-empty bag of Flamin’ Hot Doritos. His tone was not contrite. He had intentionally cut the video at its most dramatic moment, he said. The machine was, in fact, intact. Arrington stood up, revealing athletic short-shorts, and, tossing the bag of Hot Doritos aside, made his way over to the Museca cabinet.</p>

    <p>Museca was a glowing anime beacon. A neon red coil shot up through its base like a spine, supporting a console of five pastel-lit buttons, each the size of an adult hand. To the rhythm of a peppy beat, a player would press and spin these buttons at just the right time to amass points—that is, if the game worked. The cabinet, thankfully, had booted into a menu screen. “When you get something like this, you’ve got to take care of it. This is not like a Cadillac from the ‘60s or ’70s, where people are making parts for it,” said Arrington. He pressed Start. The display went blank. “Oh shit,” he said. But then baby-voice pop music blared from the speakers. “Nevermind.”</p>

    <p>These days, Museca is an extraordinary find, Arrington said. Like the other machines Arrington helps import, it’s primarily sold and played at arcades in Japan. On top of that, Museca’s publisher, Konami, discontinued the game a few years ago. The machines were recalled from across Japan, and their parts repurposed into an entirely new game called Bishi Bashi. Not many Museca cabinets survived, making them a particular prize for devoted fans of Japan’s storied arcade scene.</p>

    <p>The country’s self-sizzling pleasure palaces have attracted millions of native and foreign otaku for decades, luring them in with the promise of competition and escape for the price of just one 100-yen coin. Taito Corporation’s Space Invaders marked the industry’s launch in 1978, and in the following years, Japan’s arcade scene blossomed, giving rise to classics like Donkey Kong, Contra, and Street Fighter II. Tens of thousands of arcades sprang up, packed tight with crane games filled with wide-eyed Pokemon plushies; greasy racing sims; shimmering fantasy role-playing or strategy games; scuffed-up fighting games; and of course, the full-body high of rhythm games like Konami’s Dance Dance Revolution or Museca.</p>

    <p>Some titles, like DDR, got officially licensed or released overseas, where they’ve become cultural touchstones. But Konami, Taito, and other arcade game makers designed their best stuff exclusively for Japan, on idiosyncratic arcade hardware that was meant to stay there. “They don't want these machines to be sold outside Japan,” says Serkan Toto, CEO of Japanese consulting company Kantan Games. A lot of machines, including Museca, stipulate on their title screens that they are only meant to be played in Japan. In recent years, publishers like Konami have enforced this by ensuring their arcade games only function when networked to their proprietary server with a proprietary protocol.</p>

    <p>The logistics and price of licensing is a big reason why—music, distribution, and payment. It’s also a commercial calculation, Toto adds. “The arcade machines are not stand-alone anymore—they have to be connected to a server, which makes maintaining them, controlling them, and operating them more complex. They don’t want the hassle of providing that knowledge and those maintenance services to companies outside Japan.” Lately, the Japanese arcade chain Round1 has installed locations across the US; but outside of that, the typical American has almost no access to the thousands of authentic arcade machines that brought glory to Japan as the holy land of gaming.</p>

    <p>Today, though, Japan’s arcades are in crisis. Game centers are shuttering with heartbreaking rapidity, due in part to competition from home gaming consoles and a tax hike that raised the price of a single play. Between 2006 and 2016, the number of arcades deflated from 24,000 to 14,000. Covid accelerated this trend, emptying the arcades of regulars and tourists alike. Between October 1 and November 24, 2021, 20 arcades closed in Japan.</p>


    <p>When arcades close, their video games face one of three fates, only two of which are sanctioned by a Japanese trade association of game manufacturers. The first is getting junked in a landfill. The second is getting gutted and sold for pieces, and then junked in a landfill. (Arrington calls this “the mafia treatment.”) Finally, the third: A Japanese distributor swoops in and buys up all of a dying arcade’s machines. Some get sent around Japan to smaller arcades. Others, on the down-low, are sourced to enterprising Westerners like Arrington, a self-described “muscle guy” for the gray-market entrepreneurs who import thousands of cabinets from Japan every year.</p>


    <p>Over the past five years, as Japanese arcade machines have become more available than ever, Western demand for Japanese machines has exploded. To support that demand, an underground network of gamers has risen to the challenge of evacuating these cabinets from Japan, hauling them across the world, and hacking their code so fans like me can finally, after all these years, play.</p>


    <p>Like a lot of bad ideas, my obsession with Museca began at a Long Island mall.</p>

<h3><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/harmonix-music-gameplay-1214" target="_blank">Harmonix keeps innovating, with lasting impact</a></h3>
<p>The MIT spinout has been releasing iconic video games for more than 25 years.</p>

 <img style="display:block; height:15vw; margin-left:3vw;" src="https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__image_gallery/public/images/202112/MIT-Harmonix-01_0.jpg?itok=eEC5AI6B">

<p style="margin-top:18vw;">Every holiday season, a popular new video game causes a disproportionate amount of hype, anticipation, and last-minute shopping. But few of those games offer an entirely new way to play. Even fewer have ripple effects that reach far beyond the gaming universe.</p>

<p>When Guitar Hero was released in 2005, challenging players to hit notes to classic rock songs on guitar-like controllers, it grew from a holiday hit to a cultural phenomenon that taught a new generation to love rock ‘n’ roll music. Along the way, it showed the video game industry the power of innovative, music-based games.</p>

<p>Guitar Hero and the related Rock Band franchise were developed by Harmonix Music Systems, which formed more than 25 years ago in MIT’s Media Lab when a pair of friends began using technology to help people interact with music. Since then, it has released more than a dozen games that have helped millions of people experience the thrill of making music.</p>

<p>“The thing that we’ve always tried to accomplish is to innovate in music gameplay,” says Eran Egozy ’93, SM ’95, a professor of the practice in music and theater arts at MIT who co-founded the company with Alex Rigopulos ’92, SM ’94. “That’s what the company is constantly trying to do — creating new kinds of compelling music experiences.”</p>

<p>To further that mission, Harmonix became a part of industry giant Epic Games last month. It’s a major milestone for a company that has watched its games go from small passion projects to ubiquitous sources of expression and fun.</p>

<p>Egozy has seen Harmonix games on famous bands’ tour buses, in the offices of tech giants like Google, at bars hosting “Rock Band nights,” and being portrayed in popular TV shows. Most importantly, he’s heard from music teachers who say the games inspired kids to play real instruments.</p>

<p>In fact, Egozy just heard from his son’s school principal that the reason he plays the drums is because of Rock Band.</p>

<p>“That’s probably the most gratifying part,” says Egozy, who plays the clarinet professionally. “Of course, we had great hopes and aspirations when we started the company, but we didn’t think we would actually make such a big impact. We’ve been totally surprised.”</p>

<p>Mission-driven beginnings</p>

<p>As an undergraduate at MIT, Egozy majored in electrical engineering and computer science and minored in music. But he never thought about combining computers and music until he participated in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program under then-graduate student Michael Hawley in the Media Lab.</p>

<p>The experience inspired Egozy to pursue his master’s degree at the Media Lab’s Opera of the Future group, led by Tod Machover, where he began building software that generated music based on intuitive controls. He also met Rigopulos at the Media Lab, who quickly became a friend and collaborator.</p>

<p>“Alex had this idea: Wouldn’t it be cool if we took a joystick that’s a more friendly interface and used it to drive the parameters of our generative music system?” Egozy recalls.</p>

<p>The joystick-based system immediately became one of the most popular demos at the Media Lab, leading the pair to participate in the MIT $10K Entrepreneurship Competition (the MIT $100K today).</p>

<p>“I think MIT imbued me with a sense that there’s no point in trying to do something that someone’s already done,” Egozy says. “If you’re going to work on something, try to do something inventive. That’s a pervasive attitude all around MIT, not just at the Media Lab.”</p>

<p>As graduation arrived, Egozy and Rigopulos knew they wanted to continue working on the system, but they doubted they could find a company that would pay them to do it. Out of that simple logic, Harmonix was born.</p>

<p>The founders spent the next four years working on the technology, which led to a product called Axe that Egozy describes as a “total flop.” They also built a system for Disney at the Epcot amusement park and tried to integrate their software with karaoke machines in Japan.</p>

<p>“We sustained multiple failures trying to figure out what our business was, and it took us quite a while to discover the way to satisfy our mission, which is to let everyone in the world experience the joy of making music. As it turns out, that was through video games,” Egozy says.</p>

<p>The company’s first several video games were not huge hits, but by iterating on the core platform, Harmonix was able to steadily improve on the design and gameplay.</p>

<p>As a result, when it came time to make Guitar Hero around 2005, the founders had music, graphics, and design systems they knew could work with unique controllers.</p>

<p>Egozy describes Guitar Hero as a relatively low-budget project within Harmonix. The company had two games in development at the time, and the Guitar Hero team was the smaller one. It was also a quick turnaround: They finished Guitar Hero in about nine months.</p>

<p>Through its other releases, the Harmonix team had been trained to expect most of its sales to come in the weeks leading up to the Christmas holiday and then for sales to essentially stop. With Guitar Hero, the game sold incredibly quickly — so quickly that retailers immediately wanted more, and the company making the guitar controllers had to multiply their orders with manufacturers.</p>

<p>But what really surprised the founders was that January’s sales surpassed December’s. … Then February’s surpassed January’s. In fact, month after month, the sales graph looked like nothing Harmonix’s team of 45 people had ever seen before.</p>

<p>“It was mostly shock and disbelief within Harmonix,” Egozy says. “We just adored making Guitar Hero. It was the game we always wanted to make. Everyone at Harmonix was somehow involved in music. The company had a band room just so people could go and jam. And so the fact that it also sold really well was extremely gratifying — and very unexpected.”</p>

<p>Things moved quickly for Harmonix after that. Work on Guitar Hero 2 began immediately. Guitar Hero got taken over by Activision, and Harmonix was acquired by MTV Networks for a number of years. Harmonix went on to develop the Rock Band franchise, which brought players together to perform the lead guitar, bass, keyboard, drums, and vocals of popular songs.</p>

<p>“That was really wonderful because it was about a group effort,” Egozy says. “Rock Band was social in the sense that everyone’s together in the same room playing music together, not competitively, but working toward a common goal.”</p>

<p>An ongoing legacy</p>

<p>Over the last decade, Harmonix has continued to explore new modes of music gameplay with releases such as SingSpace, which offers a social karaoke experience, and Fuser, a DJ-inspired game that lets users mix and match different tracks. The company also released Rock Band VR, which makes players feel like they’re on stage in front of a live audience.</p>

<p>These days Egozy, who’s been on the board since he became a full-time professor at MIT in 2014, teaches 21M.385/6.185 (Interactive Music Systems), a class that combines computer science, interaction design, and music. “It’s the class I wish I had as an undergrad here at MIT,” Egozy says.</p>

<p>And every semester, the class takes a tour of the Harmonix office. He’s often told it’s students’ favorite part of class.</p>

<p>“I'm really proud of what we were able to do, and I’m still surprised and humbled by the cultural impact we had,” Egozy says. “There is a generation of kids that grew up playing these games that learned about all this music from the ’70s and ’80s. I’m really happy we were able to expose kids to all that great music.”</p>
