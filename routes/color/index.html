		<p>In design, color is often incorporated into what graphics artists create. I have often gravitated towards designs that are vibrant and colorful, rather than those that are strictly black and white or very muted. The world that we live in and encounter (for most people) is a colorful one. Oftentimes I feel as though the world isn’t colorful enough. In art and design, we have the freedom to add color to the worlds we create in our visuals. Color can be used as a means to convey how something is observed in the natural world. It can be used to demonstrate feelings and emotions. It can be used as embellishment in a piece, or as a way to draw a viewer in. Color is a tool in design that can ultimately enhance what is on our screens/on our papers. It’s common, in art education, to start your foundational year completely black and white. But when color was added, it was like the pieces came to life. Additionally, in art, we can break color down to the three primary colors: red, blue and yellow. And in printing, CMYK, aka cyan, magenta, yellow and black. It’s an amazing tool and really opens your eyes to not only the conceptual and aesthetic practices of the world, but also to the scientific and biological parts. For those able to see in color, we take in what we see and experience the vibrancy of the world in real time. It happens in our designs as well.
