				<h2>Cmd+Z allows for more creative freedom and experimentation</h2>
					<p>The undo function gives me a lot of creative freedom because it allows me to try whatever I want without having to worry or think about it. I am usually a hands-on learner and learn best through trial and error, so trying something, failing, and then being able to undo it and try again is very helpful for me.</p>

				<h2>It's Accommodating</h2>
				<p>Command Z is also very accommodating of my impulsivity (and ADHD) when I work: I need to get my thoughts and ideas down before I forget because my mind runs very quickly, but this can cause careless mistakes. In physical drawing, writing, and painting, I have to discipline myself really well and not work impulsively to avoid mistakes that will take longer to fix or work with. This becomes exhausting very quickly, but I don’t need to worry about it at all in the digital world.</p>
        		<br>
        		<p>Additionally, command Z allows me to be a perfectionist and be in complete control, which is something I have to suppress in physical art. I used to enjoy the challenges in physical art, but I don’t have the energy for it anymore especially since I know it’s easier digitally.</p>

				<h2>It's Convenient</h2>
					<p>It’s in a very convenient spot and it’s only 2 keys so it’s easy to remember. I also love command F, C, X, V, and S. Command F has saved me so much time reading or sorting through things.</p>
        			<br>
        			<p>I don’t miss messy erasing, smudging, or working around mistakes in physical drawing, painting, or writing.</p>
