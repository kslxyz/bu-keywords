	<p>Memory… “something remembered from the past; a recollection.”
Memories are uncertain and intangible. They can change through time and be lost. Memory can be called back through various triggers - objects, sound, scent, touch, taste, and so on.  We unconsciously manipulate our memories - interpreting positive memory into negative and vice versa. Minute by minute, the present turns into the past and the moments are stored in our memory. The second instances are converted into memories, they are dramatized - therefore, we cannot fully trust them. It is also interesting that we select memories that we want to keep or forget. The boundaries between what is true and what we create remain ambiguous within memories.</p>
