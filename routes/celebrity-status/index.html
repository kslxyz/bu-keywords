				<p>My friends and I consistently find ourselves talking about what are the qualifications and expectations of a celebrity. What is the difference between a celebrity and an influencer? What are the TRUE credentials that make someone an “A Lister” vs a “B Lister”? Has our understanding of the title of celebrity been convoluted and watered down from instant accessibility to these once elusive and exclusive people? A celebrity is a figment of our imagination as the onlooking audience. It is important that these people, while certainly real people like you and I, feel out of reach and almost like a caricature of those before them.</p>
				
				<p>With the introduction of social media, celebrities are closer to us than ever. Less than 20 years ago we’d only see our favorite stars only once a month at promotional events, tours, award shows, television appearances etc leaving us to clamor to see how they were styled, how they acted and even listen to what they said paying more attention to the illusive figure behind the persona. </p>

			<p>Now due to this instant ability to check in with Hollywood, this sense of emergency no longer exists. For example, if Kim Kardashian was at peak fame in 2002 her fashion statements and ability to set trends for the general public would have a greater impact. In 2022, Kardashian posts almost daily showing off PR, designer outfits, and exhibiting her luxury lifestyle for all to see. This 1984 “Big Brother” esc ability for the public to be SO in the loop has changed the definition of celebrity to a wider, more massive scope. </p>
			
			<p>The ability to see what a celebrity is doing at all times via social media (depending on how much of their life they are willing to share) is a key factor in blurring the line between celebrity and influencer. Of course the tool can be used to make a high A list celebrity, who does have the ability to feel out of touch in the eye of the general public, more down to earth or normal. But then again, do I really need to know how Kris Jenner decorated her house for Easter? No. But there is some sort of intrigue and strange curiosity that makes me want to see how over the top her decor is. Seeing how her family celebrates the holidays humanizes them as a whole but the viewer is immediately reminded of their celebrity status thanks to her massive spending to make the house look the way it does.</p>

			<p>Sometimes celebrities who choose to share a glimpse into how they act outside of the stage or screen and highlight a “real” and “organic” side via social media are met with hate from the public. After her conservatorship was terminated by the court, Britney Spears flooded Instagram with videos of her rolling around the beach topless, spinning around as fast as she could, creating on the spot dance routines in her living room, and modeling clothes in her doorway. The content Spears puts out is in a way wholesome. She does not care about her social media presence and maintaining the same image she had 13 years ago pre-conservatorship. Spears uses her platform to have fun, be goofy, and most importantly be herself.</p>

			<p>Now that the lines between celebrity and influence have been blurred so much the qualifier for “celebrity status” is to still have a level of the organic intrigue from the public from pre social media days but still have a level of mystery in a world consumed by the internet. These people who achieve the title of celebrity don’t have to put in mass amounts of effort to receive this praise either, they simply need to stay true to the brand they created. An influencer on the other hand, is striving and actively trying to mimic what they see those above them do, in hindsight they could influence the public but they are still being influenced by A List stars. </p>
